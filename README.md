# Codemods plugin for Backstage

Codemods are an automated way to _modify code_.

They can be a great tool for recurring tasks as well as applying a change on a
large number of code bases:

- updating dependencies
- changing code owners
- applying a migration/refactoring
- â€¦

This plugin brings codemods to [Backstage](https://backstage.io/), allowing
codemods to be formally defined as Backstage entities and applied to any
software entity in its catalog.
